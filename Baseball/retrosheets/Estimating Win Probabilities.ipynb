    "### Winning the game\n",
    "\n",
    "As Herm Edwards infamously said, \"You play to win the game!\". So that's where we'll start. We will try to identify how likely each team is to win. The cool thing is that we are going to do this during the game itself - so as players get hits, or outs, or whatever else, we will see how their team's chance of winning changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're gonna do a few things here. First we'll collect information known before the start of the game - how has each team been performing, what are the game conditions, etc.  Then, we'll layer in details about the game state - whats the score, who's on base, and how many outs there are. Combine the two, and you can get a good prediction of who will win, and what the final score will be, at any given time. "

    "\n",
    "Right now, we have data on each at bat in each game. These can be thought of as distinct *states*, and each has some probability of resulting in a win. A several run deficit in the bottom of the 9th is unlikely to end up as a win for the batting team. A tie game with 3 runners on is highly likely to end in a win for the batting team.\n",
    "\n",
    "By converting each of these game states into a likelihood of victory, we can quantify how much each *at bat* improved or hurt the chances of a team winning. This is how we will conceptualize the value of different batters and pitchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're building a neural net, we can get creative with the objective. In this case, we'll use all of the inputs to produce estimates of the final score for both teams. Then, we'll use the hidden state and these score estimates to produce an estimate of who will win. Training them together has a couple potential benefits: in particular, we have only one model to keep track of, and we're more likely to consider the outputs \"consistent\". It can damage trust if we estimate the home team would score more runs, but give them a low probability of winning!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also exploit one more rule in baseball - there is no concept of a negative score. If a team has already scored 2 runs, it is impossible for them to score fewer than 2 runs in the end. To bake this in, we'll take the current score as an input, and model only an additive part - so the final score is the current score, plus some non-negative component.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train it, we'll use two different losses. We'll use MSE to estimate the expected runs scored, and cross-entropy loss to get win probabilities out."

    "Let's do a quick sanity check - we'll split by whether or not the home team is predicted to win, and check how often the home team actually wins the game. On this metric, we want to see that the blue line is consistently higher than the red line - that is, in games where we predict the home team wins, they should actually win more than 50% of the time. We also expect that as the game progresses, the two will diverge more as we are more and more confident of which team will win.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first few events, the model is more or less guessing. Both lines are near 50%, so our predictions aren't strongly correlated with the outcome yet. There's a little seperation there, but not much. This isn't surprising - we've given it little information, and there is a lot of time for the outcome to change! \n",
    "\n",
    "By event 40 or so, however, the model is much more confident and accurate in its predictions. The probabilities start approaching 0 and 1, which is good. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there's a weird point for the last three events. What is this? The rules of baseball only allow the home team to bat in the bottom of the ninth inning if they are losing - otherwise, the game just ends a bit early. That means if we observe an event in 50-53, by definition, the home team is losing, so there's a weird selection bias happening. For these events, it's either clear that the home team will lose, or it must be a close game and we're uncertain. That's why the probabilities look strange at the very end."

In part, because the model has been upping the prediction all inning - it knows there's some chance a runner on third scores, and was baking that in *before* the runner scores (incidentally, this is the reason I don't like RBI as a metric.)\n",

    "We can use the exact same process to see how pitchers performed in the game. If we look at their probability of winning the game, did it get better or worse while they were pitching?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this game, the losing pitcher was Phelps on the Marlins side. He started pitching at event 46, and left the game at event 57. The Nationals had a 24% chance of winning when Phelps started pitching - by the time he left, that was up to 84%! That's absolutely a pitcher deserving a loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The winning pitcher was Stephen Strasburg. He started the game, so the Nats has a 56% chance of winning at that point. When he left, the Nats had a 40% chance of winning...wait, what? He made the situation worse?! Digging a bit deeper, that's exactly what happened. When Strasburg threw his last pitch, the Nats were down 2-1. They scored 2 runs in the bottom of the inning, but that was *after* Strasburg was done pitching. Traditional baseball stats call him the winning pitcher, but the picture is a lot more muddy!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it's not obvious that Strasburg's value should depend on how well his team bats, either...that's why we have the score predictions. When Strasburg started, we expected the Marlins to score 4.7 runs - when he left, that was down to 2.8 runs. That's a good game for a pitcher, even if they don't end up winning! That's probably a more useful metric for pitchers."
