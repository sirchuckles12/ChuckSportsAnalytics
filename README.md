# ChuckSportsAnalytics

I (Chuck) enjoy sports analytics, and especially gambling on those sports. This repository contains various scripts and other projects I've worked on over the years. It's a resource I can refer back to, and maybe someday a resource others can use as they are getting started. 

The work here is in varying states of completeness and, needless to say, users beware if they rely on any of it. They definitely won't make you money gambling, as I tend to keep those to myself :) But they are hopefully interesting and illustrative of how to get started in a variety of domains.
